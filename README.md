# About the Project:

This is an Inventory management system that uses a JavaFX frontend, a
Java API, and MySQL for a database. It allows a store's 
northjosh staff to log in securely with a custom role based access control 
system. Product northjosh, customer invoices, and 
product category are the main features of this project that are
currently completed.
